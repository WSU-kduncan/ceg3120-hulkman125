Setup
    dependencies: the files I downloaded were sudo apt install python3-pip, pip3 install -U python-dotenv, 
	pip3 install -U discord.py==1.7.3, sudo apt install python3-pip,

    how to get an API token: on bot page under the token section will be your token, but you need authentication 
                             app on your phone to have access it to generate the passcode to view it and change it
    Where to put my token:  on my .env file I need to replace my "your-bot-token" string with the code generated on discord.


Usage
    The way I commanded my code Is when I tyoe the word April Moon in the text, the API will 
	look at it and check the programming code on GitHub and see if the code is designed to respond to 
	that word. Ifit does it will output either one of these movie quotes"Luke, I am Your Father", "With Great Power 
	Comes Great Responsibility", and "YOU SHALL NOT PASS".


Research

     You could buy a second computer and use it as server to run your bot on.

    To run a bot 24/7 I can install a flask file server and add it to my python code because flask is 
	just server software that runs HTTP requests on the web, private LAN and WANs and contains many computers 
	bundled together that work together by running software on the web. By working together as One network the other computers 
	can picck up the info that another computer may request.

    You can use the cloud, which is just a remote copmuter which will continue to run the bot in a more permanent basis. 

    Or to be more simple you can just keep your computer on at all times and never turn it off no matter what.
